# Supported predicates
File ```global_types.pl``` contains the core part of the tool, that is, the implementation of the definitions as defined in the inspiring papers.
The implemented predicates are:

* ```participant_name(A)```
* ```label(Lambda)```
* ```unique_keys(KVs)```
* ```map_from_to(DomainA,DomainB,List)```
* ```pait_domain(X,Y,Left-Right)```
*
